# Python_Projects
WELCOME TO THIS REPOSITORY!

This repository contains the Data Analytics Projects done using Python!

WHY PYTHON? 

Python has been a very useful programming language for Data Analytics for many reasons, some of them being the huge number of libraries it possesses, and the ease of reading and maintaining the code.

The projects in this repository were done using the following Python libraries :
1. Numpy - For Numerical Calculations
2. Pandas - For Data Manipulation and Analysis 
3. Matplotlib - For Visualising Basic Plots
4. Seaborn - For Visualising Advanced Statistical Graphics
